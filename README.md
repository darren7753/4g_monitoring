**Note**: The data showcased in this repository has been replaced with dummy data to ensure confidentiality.

This project was commissioned by a client on 2023-08-13. If you're interested in similar work, check out my freelance data analyst profile on [Fastwork](https://fastwork.id/user/darren7753).

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to develop an intuitive dashboard for monitoring specific company data. The dashboard not only provides a detailed overview of the data, but also offers various filters and visualization tools to analyze it.

## Tools Used
For this project, I employed an array of tools to ensure a smooth and efficient dashboard experience:
- **Firebase**: Implemented for user authentication.
- **BigQuery**: Chosen for its robust data storage capabilities.
- **Polars**: Utilized for efficient handling and processing of large datasets.
- **Plotly**: Enabled the creation of interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **Streamlit**: The backbone for creating the entire dashboard interface.

## Dashboard Overview
### Login Page
Upon accessing the dashboard, users are greeted with a login page, which is integrated with Firebase. Successful authentication directs the user straight to the homepage.

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="screenshots/Screenshot (3183).png" width="100%" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="screenshots/Screenshot (3184).png" width="100%" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Daily Data Page
This page displays data on a daily basis, but users have the flexibility to filter it weekly or monthly. Several other filters are available for more granular data analysis. The visual representations predominantly include multi-area and line charts, which provide a clear view of data trends.

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="screenshots/Screenshot (3185).png" width="100%" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="screenshots/Screenshot (3186).png" width="100%" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Hourly Data Page
Similar to the daily page, this section focuses on hourly data. It offers similar filters and visualization tools to ensure users can analyze the data in-depth.

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="screenshots/Screenshot (3187).png" width="100%" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="screenshots/Screenshot (3188).png" width="100%" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
